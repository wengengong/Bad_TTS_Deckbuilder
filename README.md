A bad Table Top Simulator (TTS) deck builder for magic the gathering, Based on the great Frogtown (https://www.frogtown.me/) website (pls dont sue me frogtown). Scrapes images directly from gatherer database.

<h2>Why?</h2>

Because I was bored.

<h2>How?</h2>

 - Electron for the front end.
 - python for the back end (was originaly going to do it all in python but UI is hard in python).
